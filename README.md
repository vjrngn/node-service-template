#### Serivce Template

As a content creator, I scaffold a *LOT* of throaway projects and the structure typically remains
the same.

I got sick of doing the same thing again and again and again; so as a true programmer I saw a pattern and decided to automate.

This template is *extremely* opionated (aren't all templates 🤷🏻‍♂️😛). If you like this structure feel free to go ahead and copy it!

If you're as lazy as I am of repetitive work, here's a quicker way to get started:


```sh
yarn global add degit
# or
npm i -g degit

degit git@github.com:vjrngn/node-service-template.git some-new-project && $_

# for the no-strings-attached approach
npx degit git@github.com:vjrngn/node-service-template.git some-new-project && $_
```

Enjoy!
